		<p class="lede">Hi, I’m Kyle.</p>
		<h2>I make music. And I like sound.</h2>
		<p>I use the following software:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ableton Live</li>
			<li>Avid Pro Tools</li>
			<li>Adobe Audition</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What excites me most about production is collaboration with others. There is no better feeling than sitting down with a musician and sensing chemistry between their ideas and mine.</h3>
		<p>In high school I began collecting hardware samplers and records and attending shows in the greater Boston area. What started as a casual interest quickly became a full-time pursuit. Since then, I have produced dozens of tracks, exchanged project files with collaborators across the world, and DJed a handful of events and parties. My ultimate goal every time I start a project is to translate musical ideas into a fully-realized track that is both original and professional.</p>
		<h4>I am currently exploring interactive web technology as a means of creating a more immersive audiovisual experience.</h4>
